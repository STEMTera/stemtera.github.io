## Uploading Your First Sketch

Now, everything has been configured properly and you are ready to upload your first sketch. The quickest way to try your first sketch is to run the `Blink` example. 

Click File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink
{: .mouse }

The `Blink` sketch will be loaded into the Arduino IDE.

Click ![arduino_ide_upload button](img/arduino_ide_upload_icon.svg) Upload, and both yellow LEDs on the (STMB) will start blinking indicating the computer is uploading the sketch to the (STMB).
{: .mouse }

![(STMB) Tx Rx LED Blinking](img/stemtera_tx_rx_blink.svg){: width="75%"}

When the sketch uploading is completed, both yellow LEDs will stop blinking. The message area of the Arduino IDE will display `Done uploading`, indicating upload is completed.

At the same time, because the `Blink` sketch instructed the (STMB) to blink, you can see the red LED starts to blink.

Your first `Blink` sketch is now successfully being executed by the (STMB).
