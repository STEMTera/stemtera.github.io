## Exercise 3 - Knight Rider LED

![(STMB) - Kinght Rider LED](img/exercise_03_knightrider.svg){: .full-w }

The Knight Rider LED is inspired by the advanced artificial intelligent self-aware car from the 80's Knight Rider TV series. The car was a customized 1982 Pontiac Trans-Am easily identified by its light scanning from left to right. This exercise is to simulate the scanner light using LEDs.
