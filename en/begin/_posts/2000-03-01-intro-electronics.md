## Atoms

We all like to take things apart, and always find something smaller inside, for example, if we take a small remote controlled car apart, there are motor, gears and wires inside. If we continue breaking the motor into smaller and smaller pieces, eventually we will find that all ***matter*** is made from different types of atoms, i.e., everything is made of atoms . A single atom is about 100,000 times thinner than a human hair and can only be seen using a powerful electron microscope. 

![Atom](img/atom.svg){: .quarter-w .left }Most atoms have three different subatomic particles inside them, **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons**. The **protons** and **neutrons** are packed together forming a **nucleus** in the center of the atom. Each **proton** in the **nucleus** of an atom has a tiny positive charge, and this effectively means the **nucleus** is a big clump of positive charge. The **electron** which has a negative charge, is so much smaller than the **proton** and orbit around the **neucleus** of the atom. Atoms are electrically neutral because they have the same numbers of **protons** and **electrons**. 

## Electric Charge

Sometimes atoms can gain or lose **electrons**. Loss of **electrons** leaves an atom with a net ***postitive*** charge and gain of **electrons** leaves an atom with a net ***negative*** charge. The presence of this electric charge, either ***positive*** or ***negative***, produces an electric field. These type of charged atoms is called an ion. In a battery, the positive side has ***positive ions*** and negative side has ***negative ions***.

## Electricity

**Electrons** being negative in nature, are attracted to positive charged. By making use of this nature, **electrons** can be made to move from one atom to another. When **electrons** move between the atoms, a current of electricity is created. In certain gases and liquids, atoms with extra **protons** can also flow and creates electric current too.
