## Connect the (STMB)

![Connecting (STMB) to computer](img/connect_stemtera.svg){: .full-w }

After getting use with the user interface of Arduino IDE, you can now connect the (STMB) to your computer. You will need a [Micro USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215) for the connection. 

First, connect the larger end of the [Micro USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215) to your computer. Second, connect the other smaller end of the Micro USB cable to the (STMB). The green LED light on the (STMB) will turned on and different types of Operating System might also produce a sound indicating that a USB device has being plugged into the computer.

On a Windows computer, if you are first time connecting the (STMB), a dialog window will pop up telling you that there is a new device detected. Windows will search for the device driver installed previously and create a serial port on your computer. If you wish to know the name of the serial port, type

`Win + r`
{: .keyboard }

In the open dialog box, type

`devmgmt.msc`
{: .keyboard }

then click OK. Device Manager will be launched and display a list of devices connected to the computer. Double click ![Port Icon](img/port_icon.svg){: .textimg }` Ports (COM & LPT) `{: .backhigh }  and the name of the (STMB)'s serial port should look like ![Port Icon](img/port_icon.svg){: .textimg }` Arduino Uno (COMx) `{: .backhigh }

On a Mac computer and Linux computer, the (STMB) is automatically detected. To see the status of this automatic detection, open a terminal screen and type 

`dmesg + Enter`
{: .keyboard }

The last few lines will tell you the name of the serial port created. The serial port name for Mac and Linux computer will normally start with `/dev/tty`.

Note down the name of the serial port as you will need this to configure the Arduino IDE later.
