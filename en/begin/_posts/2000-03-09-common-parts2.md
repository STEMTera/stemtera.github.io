## Common Electronic Components 

![Common Piezo Buzzer](img/common_piezo_buzzer.svg){: .common-parts .left }Piezo buzzer is an electro-acoustic transducer that will transform AC voltages to sound pressure. In electronic circuits, it is normally driven with high-low pulses from and output pin or PWM (pulse width modulation) pin.

![Common Temperature Sensor](img/common_temp_sensor.svg){: .common-parts .left }A temperature sensor is a sensor that converts temperature into electrical signal. There are many types of temperature sensor that can output different types of signal. The TMP36 is one of the most common temperature sensor what coverts temperature into voltage, and will produce an output of 10mV per Celsius.

![Common DC Motor](img/common_dc_motor.svg){: .common-parts .left }A DC motor is an electro-mechanical machine that converts DC electrical energy to a mechanical energy. DC motor works on a principal, when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque and has a tendency to move.
