## Exercise 2 - Pulse Width Modulation PWM

For this exercise we will be using the same circuit as the one we used for exercise 1. If you have already done exercise 1, just skip to Write and Upload section.

1. Connect a JUMPER WIRE to GND and 33J.
2. Connect a JUMPER WIRE to PIN3 and 38J.
3. Connect a 330â„¦ RESISTOR to 34H and 38H.
4. Connect the anode (longer) pin of the RED LED to 34G and cathode (shorter) pin to 33G.
