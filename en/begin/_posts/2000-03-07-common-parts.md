## Common Electronic Components 

![Common Jumper Wire](img/common_jumper_wire.svg){: .common-parts .left }Jumper wire, also known as DuPont wire is an electrical wire with pin at each end, which is normally used to interconnect the components on a breadboard or other prototype circuit without soldering.

In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies and stabilize voltage.
