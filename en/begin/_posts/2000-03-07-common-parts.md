## Common Electronic Components 

![Common Jumper Wire](img/common_jumper_wire.svg){: .common-parts .left }Jumper wire, also known as DuPont wire is an electrical wire with pin at each end, which is normally used to interconnect the components on a breadboard or other prototype circuit without soldering.

![Common Capacitor](img/common_capacitor.svg){: .common-parts .left }Capacitor is a passive two-terminal component that stores electrical energy in an electric field, which are normally used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass. In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies and stabilize voltage.
