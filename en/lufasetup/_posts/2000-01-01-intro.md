## Introduction

![(STMB) Block Diagram](../begin/img/stemtera_breadboard_block_diagram.svg){: .three-quarter-w-w .center }

Inside the (STMB) there are two micro-controllers, ATmega328P and ATmega32U2. When operating in normal Arduino mode, the ATmega328P interacts with external devices and the ATmega32U2 act as a  TTL to USB converter. Both working together as an Arduino UNO board.

Since the IO pins of the ATmega32U2 are exposed on the tie points of the (STMB), we can fully utilize the IO pins of the ATmega32U2 and use it as an independent micro-controller. The ATmega32U2 is a very useful micro-controller for USB device development because of its native USB capability. 

There are 6 steps to get the LUFA environment installed:

1. Install AVR Toolchain
2. Install DFU Programmer
3. Install DFU Driver
4. Install MinGW
5. Install LUFA
6. Compile & Execute (STMB) HID Keyboard Demo

In this guide, we will go through each of the steps in setting up the LUFA development environment for the ATmega32U2.   

## Step 1 - Install AVR Toolchain

In order to compile the source code of LUFA we need the AVR Toolchain from Atmel. The Atmel AVR 8-bit and 32-bit Toolchain 3.4.1 is recommended because this version has all the required tools.

Download the recommended AVR Toolchain from

[Atmel AVR 8-bit and 32-bit Toolchain 3.4.1](http://www.atmel.com/images/avr-toolchain-installer-3.4.1.1195-win32.win32.x86.exe)
{: .browser}

Once the download is completed, execute the EXE file and proceed with the installation. When asked to choose for features and folder, just click `Next` to proceed with the default selection.

![AVR Toolchain Installation Wizard](img/AVR_Toolchain_Install.svg){: .three-quarter-w-w .center }

After the installation is completed, type

`Win + r`
{: .keyboard }

In the open dialog box, type

`cmd`
{: .keyboard }

then click OK. A `Command Prompt` window will be displayed. On the `Command Prompt` window type,

`avr-gcc -v`
{: .keyboard }

You should see the `avr-gcc` enviroment settings and version number as below:

![avr-gcc command prompt screen](img/avr-gcc-v.svg){: .three-quarter-w-w  .center }

AVR Toolchain is now installed on your computer.
{: .success }

If you can't see similar result as above, the AVR Toolchain was not properly installed. Please try Step 1 again.
{: .info }

## Step 2 - Install DFU Programmer

`dfu-programmer` is a multi-platform command line programmer for Atmel micro-controllers with a USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) bootloader. The ATmega32U2 inside the (STMB) comes pre-programmed with the USB DFU bootloader. 

Download the `dfu-programmer` from

[DFU Programmer 0.7.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/files/dfu-programmer/0.7.2/dfu-programmer-win-0.7.2.zip/download)
{: .browser }

For Linux/Mac download the tar gz source for the `dfu-programmer` from [Linux/Mac DFU Programmer 0.7.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/files/dfu-programmer/0.7.2/)
{: .info }

Once the download is completed, unzip the package to a temporary location. Copy `dfu-programmer.exe` to the `bin` folder of the AVR Toolchain (default AVR Toolchain's `bin` folder is at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\AVR Tools\AVR Toolchain\bin`)

![Copy dfu-programmer to bin of AVR Toolchain](img/dfu-copy.svg){: .full-w }


When copied correctly, you can see that the `dfu-programmer.exe` is in the same folder as the other tools like, `date.exe`, `dd.exe`, `df.exe`, `echo.exe` and etc.

`dfu-programmer` is now installed with the AVR Toolchain.
{: .success }

Do not remove the unzipped files of the `dfu-programmer`, they are needed for DFU driver installation later. 
{: .warning }

## Step 3 - Install DFU Driver

When the ATmega32U2 of the (STMB) operates in DFU mode, it requires DFU driver to work properly.

Connect the (STMB) to the computer, if you have not connect the (STMB) to your computer before, please refer to the (STMB) Beginner's Guide section [Connect the (STMB)](http://learn.stemtera.com/en/begin/#page7).

Type the following to launch device manager:

`Win + r`
{: .keyboard}

In the open dialog box, type

`devmgmt.msc`
{: .keyboard }

then click OK. Device Manager will be launched and display a list of devices connected to the computer. Double click ![Port Icon](../begin/img/port_icon.svg){: .textimg }` Ports (COM & LPT) `{: .backhigh }  and the name of the (STMB)'s serial port should look like ![Port Icon](../begin/img/port_icon.svg){: .textimg }` Arduino Uno (COMx) `{: .backhigh }

Now, we need to make the ATmega32U2 to operate in DFU mode. To do that, use a jumper wire, connect one end of the jumper wire to `GND` and the other end to `RST`. While the jumper is still connected to `GND` and `RST`, you will notice that the serial port of the (STMB) has disappear from device manager.

Remove the jumper wire and Windows will pop up a message saying a new device is found and it will try to locate the driver for it. Because DFU driver is not officially in Windows' driver repository, the search for the driver will most likely failed. 

When this happens, you will see a device called `Arduino Uno DFU` with an exclamation mark shown under `Other devices` in the device manager. 

![Unknown DFU Device](img/Unknown_Device.svg){: .half-w .center}

Right click on this device and select `Update driver`.

![Update Arduino DFU Driver](img/Update_DFU_Driver.svg){: .three-quarter-w-w .center }

On the `Update driver` window, select `Browse my computer for driver software`. Click `Browse` button and navigate to the `dfu-programmer` folder that was previously unzipped in STEP 2. The folder's name is as below:

    dfu-programmer-win-0.7.2\dfu-prog-usb-1.2.2

Click next after selecting the above folder and Windows will start to install the driver. Click `Install` when the driver installer ask "*Would you like to install this device software?*" If the installation went well, you will see the following screen.

![DFU Driver Installation Success](img/DFU_Update_Success.svg){: .three-quarter-w-w .center}

Click `Close` and the DFU driver installation is now completed.
{: .success }

## Step 4 - Install MinGW

MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is an open source software development environment for Windows. It includes a port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Binutils for Windows and miscellaneous utilities.

Download MinGW installer from

[MinGW Installer](http://www.mingw.org/download/installer)
{: .browser }

Once the download is finished, execute the installer `mingw-get-setup.exe`. Click `Install` follow by `Continue` to install as default preference. The installer will start to download and update necessary catalogue files. Once this process is completed, click `Continue`.

MinGW Installation Manager screen will be displayed as below:

![MinGW Installation Screen](img/MinGW_Installer.svg){: .full-w .center}

Click `mingw32-base` and select `Mark for Installation`.

Click `msys-base` and select `Mark for Installation`.

When properly marked for installation, the checkbox next to the selected item will show an arrow that looks like a letter `C`.

Click `Installation` menu, then select `Apply Changes`. When the `Schedule of Pending Actions` window ask `Okay to proceed?`, click `Apply` and the installer will start to download the required files. Wait for the installer to show `All changes were applied successfully; you may now close this dialogue.`, then click `Close`. Click `X` of the `MinGW Installation Manager` to exit.

The installation of MinGW is now completed.
{: .success }

## Step 5 - Install LUFA

Download LUFA-151115 from

[STEMTera LUFA Development files](https://github.com/STEMTera/STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project/archive/master.zip)
{: .browser }

Unzip `STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project-master.zip` to the Desktop. The resultant should have a folder structure like below:

    C:\Users\[user name]\Desktop\STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project-master

You could use `git` to clone the project if you wish to. The project git is [https://github.com/STEMTera/STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project.git](https://github.com/STEMTera/STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project.git)
{: .info }

LUFA is now installed on your Desktop.
{: .success }

## Step 6 - Compile & Execute (STMB) HID Keyboard Demo

Type

`Win + r`
{: .keyboard }

In the open dialog box, type

`cmd`
{: .keyboard }

then click OK. A `Command Prompt` window will be displayed. On the `Command Prompt` window type,

`cd "Desktop\STEMTera-Breadboard-B328-LUFA-Demo-Project-master\Demos\Device\ClassDriver\Keyboard"`
{: .keyboard }

Type

`dir`
{: .keyboard}

You should see the following files in the directory:

Type 

`make`
{: .keyboard }

and `make` will start to compile the (STMB) HID Keyboard Demo. Once the compilation is finished, the following `make` messages will be displayed.

```

If the `make` process is successful, you will see 

    [INFO]    : Finished building project "Keyboard".

telling you that the "Keyboard" demo is compiled and ready.

To install the "Keyboard" demo to the (STMB), type

`make dfu-launch`
{: .keyboard }

`make` will launch `dfu-programmer` to flash the "Keyboard.hex" into the (STMB). A successful flashing will have messages similar to:

```
 [DFU]     : Programming FLASH with dfu-programmer using "Keyboard.hex"
dfu-programmer atmega32u2 erase
Checking memory from 0x0 to 0x6FFF...  Not blank at 0x1.
Erasing flash...  Success
make: [dfu-launch] Error 5 (ignored)
dfu-programmer atmega32u2 flash Keyboard.hex
Checking memory from 0x0 to 0x10FF...  Empty.

[>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>]  Success
Validating...  Success
0x1100 bytes written into 0x7000 bytes memory (15.18%).
dfu-programmer atmega32u2 launch --no-reset
```

As soon as `make dfu-launch` has finished, you should be able to see a `HID Keyboard Device` appear on the `Keyboards` section of Device Manager.

If there was no extra `HID Keybaord Device` showing, confirm that the dfu programming is successful, check for 

    0%                            100%  Programming 0x1100 bytes...
    [>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>]  Success

The above two lines show that `programming` of 0x110 bytes is successful. 

    0%                            100%  Reading 0x7000 bytes...
    [>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>]  Success

The above two lines show that `dfu-programmer` has successfully read back the "Keyboard.hex" that was programmed into the (STMB).


    Validating...  Success
    0x1100 bytes written into 0x7000 bytes memory (15.18%).

If the read back code compared with the original compiled `hex` code and produced a matched result, `Validating... Success` message will be displayed.

Ignore the line `make: [dfu-launch] Error 5 (ignored)`, this is not an error. It was produced because the command `dfu-programmer atmega32u2 erase` returned a warning due to the device was not blank before erase.
{: .warning }

(STMB) HID Keyboard Demo is now installed on the board. Launch NOTEPAD on the computer and use a jumper wire to short GND and PB0 ( or PB1, PB2, PB3, PB4, PB5). Each pin will produce a character on NOTEPAD like a keyboard being typed.
{: .success }
